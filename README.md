# PYbullet_Bachelorthesis

This project aims to give an insight into robot dynamics, control and their impact
on real-time scenarios. This involves the modelling of a two-link robot and further testing
on simulation. Certain control techniques are needed for robots to operate effectively. This
project gives intuition on the simulation of control techniques and dynamics to work with a
two and six DoF robot. Multiple kinds of research were carried out to understand and
simulate the manipulator dynamics and control in a physics-based simulator
